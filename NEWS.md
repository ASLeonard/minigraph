Release 0.3-r242 (7 August 2019)

Release 0.2-r235 (19 July 2019)
-------------------------------

This release fixes multiple minor bugs. It also considers k-mer matches and
improves the accuracy of graph chaining. Nonetheless, the old chaining
algorithm, albeit simple, works quite well. The improvement is marginal.
